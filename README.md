## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had **trouble with auto layout constraints**. I know where the autolayout button is at the bottom of the xcode interface, and I know how to set constraints. However, my problem is I don't fully grasp the implication/consequences of using autolayout. For instance, when after setting all constraints, and using stack views, my imageView objects still go off screen or are positioned wrongly when I rotate views in the simulator. 
-- In short, I would appreciate it if you guys **go over how to ensure support for all screen sizes**. I searched online and couldn't find any good resource. Most of the resources I got were doing it programmatically, and were all very old (videos were made 3-5 years ago)
-- Tried doing table view for scrolling but could not find a good resource to teach me.
